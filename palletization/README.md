# 3D Tetris Palletization System

This project defines a basic 3D palletization and block configuration pipeline designed to generate robot-friendly stacking plans.

## Files and Their Roles

### `user_input.py`
Handles interactive input from the user. Prompts for:
- Block dimensions (width, height, depth)
- Clearance (in all directions)
- Number of rows, columns, and floors

### `visualizer.py`
Visualizes the pallet structure created using `matplotlib`. It reads the configuration from `configurations.json` and renders a 3D visualization.

### `configurations.json`
JSON file that stores:
- Block size
- Required clearance
- Number of blocks in X, Y, Z directions (columns, rows, floors)
- Positions of each block

This is generated by `logic.py` and used by the rest of the pipeline.

### `configurations.py`
Helper module to parse and manage the configuration file (`configurations.json`). Provides access to block size, clearances, and layout structure.

### `Leo's_original_3D_tetris.py`
Original prototype logic for arranging 3D blocks in space. Includes experimental stacking behavior and concept generation. Kept for reference.

### `logic.py`
Processes the `configurations.json` and computes the final structured format.
Outputs the structure as JSON and saves it as `configurations.json`.

## Example Workflow

1. Execute `logic.py` to convert the layout into robot-usable format.
2. Use `visualizer.py` to check your 3D block layout.
