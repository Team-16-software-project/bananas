| Field | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `pallet_size` | A list `[width, length, height]` in centimeters (cm) specifying the size of the pallet. |

| Property | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Block base size | 3.8 cm |
| Margin between blocks (X and Y dimensions) | 0.3 cm |
| Effective block size | 4.1 cm (3.8 cm + 0.3 cm) |
| Block positioning | Center coordinates `[x, y, z]` are specified relative to the pallet's bottom-left-back corner at (0,0,0). |

- **Width (X-axis)**: left ‚Üí right
- **Length (Y-axis)**: back ‚Üí front
- **Height (Z-axis)**: bottom ‚Üí top
- Blocks are placed **centered** at the `[x, y, z]` position.
- **Margin of 0.3 cm** is included **in X and Y directions** to prevent blocks from touching each other.
